ANCESTRO
========

The Ancestry Ontology (Ancestro) provides a systematic description of the ancestry concepts used in the [NHGRI-EBI Catalog of published genome-wide association studies](www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas).  It includes a list of countries, regions and major areas (essentially continents), as well as a fairly exhaustive list of country- or region-specific ancestral groups, uncategorised ancestral groups and population isolates.
